// <---------------------- Prototypes ------------------------>

// Prototypes are the mechanism by which javascript objects inherit features from one another
// objects can have a prototype which acts as a template object (that contains methods and props) it inherits methods and properties from 
// we can have multiple objects that share the same prototype
// intermediate object wrappers --> String, Number etc they have the prototype

// String.prototype.somefunction = () => console.log(this)
// for these methods this refers to the string on which method was called
// its not recommended to add methods like this
// we can also override built in functions

// prototype is the actual object the new objects inherit from and 
// __proto__ is a reference to prototype object
// objtype.__proto__ gives the prototype object


// <---------------------- Object Oriented Programming ----------------------->

// it all has to do with one central idea .. organizing our code, designing and structuring our apps by breaking things into
// distinct patterns of objects

// rgb(23,45,123)
//  #EFC768
// rgba(34,43,32, 0.5)
// hsl(180,50%,50%)
// if i want to find oppsoite color then just add 180 to hue in hsl format
// all heading elements have same same prototype which is HTMLHeadingElement

// <--------------- Factory Functions ------------------>

// a function that creates objects with properties and methods and return them
// const { a, b , c} = this; destructuring values from this
// to avoid passing args each time we can take help of objects and defining methods in them
// this is not the ideal way to create objects, is not commonly used.. comes into picture "constructor funcs"
// the drawback is that the objects created with these functions have unique copy of methods
// everytime an object is created .. these methods are recreated
// firstObj.method === secObj.method ---> gives false coz they are not the same
// but if i do "h1".slice === "hello".slice ---> it gives true becsuse slice is same which is defined in the prototype "String" 
// we dont have an easy way to do so using factory funcs ...comes into picture "constructor funcs"

// <----------------- Constructor Functions -------------->

// convention to start with capital letter
// function random(r,g,b) {
//     this.r = r;
//     this.g = g;
//     this.b = b;
// }
// now if we do random() ---> it will give undefined
// but we wanted an object with r,g,b as inbuilt props
// comes into picture ... "new"
// when the new keyword wasn used this referred to window

// <--------- new Keyword ------->

// Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object. For convenience, let's call it newInstance.
// links (sets the constructor of) this obj to another obj (in the __proto__)
// passes the newly created object in Step 1 as the this context
// returns this if function doesnt return its own object
// Points newInstance's [[Prototype]] to the constructor function's prototype property, if the prototype is an Object. Otherwise, newInstance stays as a plain object with Object.prototype as its [[Prototype]].
// Note: Properties/objects added to the constructor function's prototype property are therefore accessible to all instances created from the constructor function.
// Executes the constructor function with the given arguments, binding newInstance as the this context (i.e. all references to this in the constructor function now refer to newInstance).
// If the constructor function returns a non-primitive, this return value becomes the result of the whole new expression. Otherwise, if the constructor function doesn't return anything or returns a primitive, newInstance is returned instead. (Normally constructors don't return a value, but they can choose to do so to override the normal object creation process.)
// Classes can only be instantiated with the new operator â€” attempting to call a class without new will throw a TypeError.

// using this we can add methods to prototype rather than individual objects/instances
// but if we just add this.func --> it will still be not added to prototype
// we basically have to define the function outside the constructor and add to its prototype
// Color.prototype.rgb = () {some function} this way adds methods diirectly to prototype
// this all was done so that methods are not recreated everytime .. rather than taking copy ofthe same by adding it to protype of constructor function
// which is on the left side of . is the value of this
// constructor defines kind of a recipe
// now ColorOne.method === ColorTwo.method ---> gives true ... since it is inside the proto
// you dont want to use arrow functions when dealing with constructors and stuff coz this behaves differently for arrow functions
// but now since we have to define methods seperately .... so we have prettier way to do the same stuff ...laoding "Classes"
